# Important Note 

By no means this Django app can't be considered a successful code test and needs a ton of IMPROVMENTS and that's because the lack of time i have due to working extra hours at my current job solving urgent production issues. Absolutely it does not represent my real coding skills and i can do a lot more if i had enough time. You may check this repo, it is a [Django side project](https://github.com/Ba7er/online-shop) i used to work on. I am Not expecting to here from you again, just wanted to submit the code anyway hope you will consider the given circumstances.
